# Integration

This section provides instructions for seamlessly integrating our HCL Digital Solutions products into Keycloak using the OIDC protocol. Additionally, you can find details on turning Keycloak into an identity broker by configuring other identity providers against it. Our step-by-step instructions lay out the setup process and touch on available options. The documentation also serves as a exploratory area for additional ways of configuring your products and sample scenarios to enable particular use cases or product capabilities. Once thoroughly validated and refined, they build the basis for expanding the respective official product documentation.
