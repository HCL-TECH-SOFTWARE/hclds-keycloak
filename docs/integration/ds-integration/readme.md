# Integrating HCL Digital Solutions Products

This section provides instructions for seamlessly integrating our HCL Digital Solutions products into Keycloak using the OIDC protocol. Our step-by-step instructions lay out the setup process and touch on available options. The documentation also serves as a exploratory area for additional ways of configuring your products and sample scenarios to enable particular use cases or product capabilities. Once thoroughly validated and refined, they build the basis for expanding the respective official product documentation.

All instructions are written in a way to work with the HCL DS Keycloak service, but are generally compatible with other IdPs. For each product, there is one section explaining the setup within the HCL DS Keycloak service, and one section that focuses on the the product specific adjustments.
